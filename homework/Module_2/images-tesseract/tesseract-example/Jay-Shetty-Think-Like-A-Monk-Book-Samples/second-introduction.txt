jally impressed when I found out that hed been a gy,
eCle

which is the MIT of India and, like MIT, nearly e
4 traded that opportunity to become a monk,
at my friends and I were chasing. Either he :

at IIT Bombay;
sible to get into. He

away from everything th
crazy or he was onto something.

My whole life P'd been fascinated by people who'd em from noth
g-—rags-to-riches stories. Now, for the first time, I was in
‘4 deliberately done the opposite. Hed given y
we should a// want. But instead of being

to somethin

presence of someone who

the life the world had told me
an embittered failure, he appeared joyous, confident, and at peace. In fa

he seemed happier than anyone I'd ever met. At the age of eighteen, | had
encountered a lot of people who were rich. I'd listened to a lot of people
who were famous, strong, good-looking, or all three. But I don’t think T¢
met anyone who was truly happy. |

Afterward, I pushed my way through the crowds to tell him how
amazing he was, and how much he’d inspired me. “How can I spend mor
time with you?” I heard myself asking. I felt the urge to be around peopk
who had the values I wanted, not the things I wanted. :

The monk told me that he was traveling and speaking in the UK all

that week, and I was welcome to come to the rest of his events. And so_

I did.
